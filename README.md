# TravellerEx

This is a utility to assist the generation of Traveller characters and eventually planets.

So far I can randomly generate Army characters.

TODO:
- Print the character summary
- Handle the specialised skills (gun combat, blade combat, and vehicles )
  Planning to use a random selection (prioritise weapons that the character gets a bonus for,
  50% enhance same vs random choice)
