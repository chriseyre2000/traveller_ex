# TravellerEx

This is a utility to assist the generation of Traveller characters (and eventually planets).

Traveller is a RPG that has a mini game for generating characters. 
You end up with slightly experienced adventures.
It's possible for a character to die during character generation!

So far I can randomly generate the six core professions.

TODO:
- Print the character summary
- Handle the specialised skills (gun combat, blade combat, and vehicles )
  Planning to use a random selection (prioritise weapons that the character gets a bonus for,
  50% enhance same vs random choice)

It's interesting how dangerous the Scout service is.
